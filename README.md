# Cover crop biomass modeling using Machine Learning and Artificial Neural Networks

## Overview

This repository contains Python scripts for cover crop aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation using vegetation indices (VIs), spectral bands (SBs), structural features (SFs), and texture features (TFs) derived from UAV imagery. The workflow includes feature selection using variance inflation factor (VIF), hyperparameter optimization, machine learning (ML) and artificial neural network (ANN) model training, SHAP-based explainability analysis, and export of model outputs.

The repository was developed to support reproducible analysis associated with the manuscript:

cd Cover_crop_biomass
```

Install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Workflow

Run the main script:

```bash
python src/main.py
```
---

# Workflow Pipeline

1. Load training and testing data  
2. Generate feature combinations  
3. Apply VIF-based feature selection  
4. Standardize features and target variable  
5. Train models using Optuna or RandomizedSearchCV  
6. Perform cross-validation  
7. Train final model on full dataset  
8. Evaluate on training and test sets  
9. Compute SHAP feature importance  
10. Save outputs to Excel files

---

## Reproducibility

To improve reproducibility:

* Fixed random seeds were applied for NumPy and PyTorch operations
* Deterministic CUDA settings were enabled
* Hyperparameter optimization used a fixed Optuna sampler seed

Example seed setting:

```python
SEED = 42
```

---

## Input Data

The workflow expects Excel datasets containing:

* Predictor variables
* Biomass target variable

Example:

```text
AGB_train_test.xlsx
├── train
└── test
```

---

## Outputs

The workflow generates:

* Model performance metrics
* Predicted vs observed values
* Best hyperparameters
* SHAP feature importance
* Trial optimization history
* Processing time summaries

Outputs are saved as Excel files inside the `outputs/` directory.
